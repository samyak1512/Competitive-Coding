Tricks for slicing and making pref array

Prefix array
pref = [0]
for i in range(n):
    pref.append(pref[-1] + arr[i])

if we do pref[r+1]-pref[l] > k:
this means we are including both r and l elements
pref[r+1] - pref[l] == sum(arr[l:r+1])

Slicing Array
if we write arr[l:r] then we are including lth element but not rth element. So if we need to include both the elements, we will write arr[l:r+1].
